## Topic: Microservices Architecture

Microservices architecture is a software design approach where an application
is built as a collection of small, independent services. Each service focuses
on a single business function and communicates with other services via lightweight APIs. It is the modern standard for cloud-native apps.

Microservices allow teams to develop, deploy, and scale services independently.

### How it handles Aritificial Intelligence (AI): 
- Each AI task (chat, vision, search) lives in its own "mini-app." 
- If the Chat AI crashes, the Search AI and the rest of the website keep working.

Microservices are often recommended for large, complex apps like Netflix or Spotify that require constant updates and availability.

### Key Characteristics of Microservices
- Each service is independently deployable
- Services communicate using APIs (HTTP/REST)
- Each service can use its own technology stack
- Failure in one service does not crash the entire system

### Benefits of Microservices
- Better scalability
- Faster development and deployment
- Easier maintenance
- Improved fault isolation
